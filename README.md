[GHUB NOW](https://ghub.now.sh)
> A micro-service that redirects to repository page of npm package, based on [@Zeit](https://github.com/zeit)'s [micro](https://ghub.now.sh/micro) and hosted on Now.sh

SOON: Better readme, build and release flow. Currently just prototype, stable - nothing will be touched on source.
